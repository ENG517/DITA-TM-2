### Reflective comments 1

The map for this section outlines how to grayscale an image inside Figma. Reuse cases for concepts include C_Negative_Space because the content of it applies to procedures regarding grayscaling images and importing images based on image types. We decided to include accessibility testing as a task for this one since grayscaling an image also involves ensuring the changes are visible across color vision abilities. One reuse case for references includes R_Plugins for this procedure because the plugins are also included in this topic across procedures. Hotkeys as a reuse case apply across scenarios and procedures because they are useful to know as a skill, regardless of a user’s needs within Figma.

## Scenario 2 - Vectorizing Images / Illustrator for Vectoring

6. T_Fill_Frame
7. R_Image_Types
8. R_Supported_Plugins

### Reflective Comments 2

The map for section two shows how to vectorize a raster image using a third-party plugin. The distinction between raster vs. vector images is critical for understanding the exigency behind the procedure, and the bitmap concept topic provides further insight into this distinction. All of the task topics are pivotal to the process of conversion. Supported plugins provide supplementary information on navigating plugin pages, and how plug-ins operate, and the image types reference topics elucidate different important image formats.

## Scenario 3 - Importing Images / Illustrator for Image Editing

### Map 3

1. C_Negative_Space
2. C_Raster_vs_Vector images
3. T_Create_Frame
4. T_Fill_Frame
5. T_Scale_image
6. T_Rotate_Image

8. R_Image_Rasters
9. R_Image_Types
10. R_Hotkeys

### Reflective comments 3

This procedure explains how to import an image into Figma for editing. The map outlines types of image files (rasters and vectors) and how to work with and adjust the image scale and orientation in Figma. We decided it was important that users understand the differences between the two types of images to work with and the different file types Figma supports, so we included concept and reference topics about both. We also included a concept topic about how to use negative space in design when creating and changing the imported image. 

# Overall thoughts on the process and collaboration+project management strategies

One strategy we implemented to ensure consistency and clarity about information, tasks, and resources needed to complete the project was the use of a communal project daycare document. Frequent Zoom meetings to work together and get on the same page were extremely helpful, and all merging took place via screen share. We discussed problems quickly and effectively, utilizing the discussion items tab of the spreadsheet and messaging in WhatsApp to strategize solutions upon working together for our scheduled Zoom meetings. 

We look forward to further expanding upon this topic model in the next unit and growing together for this project!
